# Portfolio
Some examples of my programming work! Feel free to take a look! There are 6 files found here, 5 of them are homeworks from my course in R and the other file is a project I created in that same class highlighting functions of my choice and their purposes and descriptions. 

-  Bio 316 HW 2.R is an assignment that focused on the basics of R such as creating comments, vectors, installing/loading packages, and finally creating objects.
-  Bio 316 HW 3.R is an assignment that focused on R markdown and its specific syntax and layout as well as loading data into R studio and filtering said data.
-  Bio 316 HW 4.R is an assignment that focused on joining/filtering data frames in R studio and then running statisical analysis such as an aov test or linear regression tests to determine significance.
-  Bio 316 HW 5.R is an assignment that focused on statistical tests like ancova, aov, and multi-model inference and demonstrating proficiency in using them.
-  Bio 316 HW 7.R is an assignment that focused on code iteration and making code very reproducible and easy to "copy + paste" code during scripting.
-  The final file Bio 316 Function Tutorial is an assignment that highlights 3 functions of the dndR package and explains and demonstates them.
