# Portfolio
Here is a collection of some of my work in a R programming course I took in the summer of 2024! Feel free to take a look! There are 6 files found here, 5 of them are homeworks from my course in R and the other file is a project I created in that same class highltighting functions of my choice and their purposes and descriptions.
